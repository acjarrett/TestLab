# TestLab
Space for anyone to practice using Git.  See practice sample below:

1. Clone Repository
2. Add a simple text file to the Repo
3. Check Status of Repository
4. Commit text file to Master
5. Push Text File to Origin
6. Pull everyone's Text File
7. Create a branch and modify your text file
8. Switch back to Master branch and check the text file
9. Switch back and Merge Text File with Master
10. Push Merged File to Origin
11. Check history of the file using log
12. Check diff between current file and the previous version
13. Create a new file using the *.ig extention
14. Assuming it's in the .ignore file, check the status and verify it will not be added to Git
15. Modify File but instead of Merging, revert back prior to the last commit.  It's okay to do this by creating another commit
16. Reset back to what is in Origin
17. Practice using the GUI in Github or Git-GUI
